# FutsalBook Nepal - Bug Fixes & Feature Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Booking Functionality Bug ✅
**Problem**: The booking page was just redirecting to facility details instead of allowing actual bookings.

**Solution**: 
- Completely redesigned `BookingPage.tsx` with full booking functionality
- Added date selection with validation (30-day advance booking window)
- Implemented time slot generation based on facility operating hours
- Added booking form with special requests field
- Integrated booking API with proper error handling
- Added booking confirmation and navigation flow

### 2. Role-Based Dashboard Issue ✅
**Problem**: All user roles (user, owner, admin) were seeing the same dashboard.

**Solution**:
- Created separate dashboard components for each user role:
  - `UserDashboard.tsx` - For regular users (booking history, quick actions)
  - `OwnerDashboard.tsx` - For facility owners (facility management, revenue stats)
  - `AdminDashboard.tsx` - For administrators (system management, analytics)
- Modified `DashboardPage.tsx` to render different dashboards based on user role
- Each dashboard has role-specific features and navigation

## New Features Added

### 3. Complete Booking Management System ✅
- **BookingsListPage.tsx**: View all user bookings with filtering and search
- **BookingDetailPage.tsx**: Detailed booking view with cancellation functionality
- Added booking status management (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
- Implemented booking cancellation with reason tracking

### 4. Owner Management Pages ✅
- **OwnerFacilitiesPage.tsx**: Manage all owned facilities
- **OwnerFacilityDetailPage.tsx**: Individual facility management (placeholder)
- **AddFacilityPage.tsx**: Add new facilities (placeholder)
- **OwnerBookingsPage.tsx**: Manage facility bookings (placeholder)

### 5. Enhanced Navigation & Routing ✅
- Added new routes for booking management (`/bookings`, `/bookings/:id`)
- Added owner-specific routes (`/owner/facilities`, `/owner/bookings`, etc.)
- Added admin route placeholder (`/admin/*`)
- Implemented proper role-based route protection

### 6. UI/UX Improvements ✅
- Added missing CSS classes (`btn-red`, `btn-outline-red`)
- Created comprehensive booking form with real-time validation
- Added proper loading states and error handling
- Implemented responsive design for all new components
- Added consistent styling across all dashboards
